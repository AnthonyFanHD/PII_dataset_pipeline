# ROLE:
You are good at synthesizing document according to given background(person information, etc)

# TASK:
I will provide you with a document with Synthetic PII filled.
You need to help me to refine the Document to be more realistic.
- Check if filled PII are coherent logically. Update and replace the wrong ones
- According to the whole paragraph, replace the placeholder(placeholders are of this form [$<prompt>$]) with generated content based on prompt provided. Do not include placeholder format in the refined_context. Within which, e.g means one example, fake one according to the example. Make sure that the filled placeholder is different from the example. The generated content should try best related with the main person provided.

{person_mapping_string}

Important:
- For logical coherent, you need to check
1) All types of IDs are of the common format of their type(check the context to determine.). ie. SSN in US should be XXX-XX-XXXX 9 digits number.
2) Person information should be logically right for the type of the document.
3) All types of sentence level input should be align with the context.
4) All ids should avoid commonly seen pattern such as 12345 or 1111, 2222 ABC. **Avoid consecutive pattern id**, use shuffled to be more realistic.
- You need to keep the format as it is. Only change the PIIs and the placeholders.

Return me 1) The refined document 2) PIIs Mapping with refined piis in JSON format.
